# PhishingDetection-Ethereum
As the most famous application of blockchain, cryptocurrency has suffered huge economic losses due to phishing scams. 
Our work shares phishing account information from Etherscan and the code for how to crawl it. 
In addition, the trans2vec algorithm for detection was shared. 
In our work, accounts and transactions in Ethereum are treated as nodes and edges, so detection of phishing accounts can be modeled as a node classification problem.
